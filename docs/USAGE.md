# Code Review Graph — User Guide

**Applies to:** v2.3.6

## Installation

```bash
pip install code-review-graph
code-review-graph install    # auto-detects and configures all supported platforms
code-review-graph build      # parse your codebase
```

`install` detects which AI coding tools you have, writes the correct MCP configuration for each one, and installs platform-native hooks where supported. Restart your editor/tool after installing.

To target a specific platform instead of auto-detecting all:

```bash
code-review-graph install --platform codex
code-review-graph install --platform cursor
code-review-graph install --platform claude-code
```

### Supported Platforms

## Core Workflow

### 1. Build the graph (first time only)
```
/code-review-graph:build-graph
```
Parses your entire codebase. Takes ~10s for 500 files.

### 2. Review changes (daily use)
```
/code-review-graph:review-delta
```
Reviews only files changed since last commit plus the graph-derived impact radius. Relevant review and impact responses include compact estimated `context_savings` metadata. Across the 6 benchmark repositories, graph queries use ~82x fewer tokens per question (median; range 38x–528x) than reading the whole corpus — see the [README benchmarks](../README.md#benchmarks) and [REPRODUCING.md](REPRODUCING.md) for the methodology.

For a compact payload that can be pasted directly into a review agent, use:

```bash
code-review-graph detect-changes --for-review --max-tokens 2000
```

The `--for-review` payload uses repo-relative paths, deterministic priority ordering, `file:line` review priorities, de-noised test gaps, affected-flow summaries, truncation metadata, and a scope-honest `savings_record`.

### 3. Review a PR
```
/code-review-graph:review-pr
```
Comprehensive structural review of a branch diff with blast-radius analysis.

When the graph may be stale, run the one-shot CLI flow:

```bash
code-review-graph review-context --base origin/main --max-tokens 2000
```

This refreshes the graph with the existing update path, then emits the same compact review payload as `detect-changes --for-review`.

For section-oriented reviews, add one or more scoped path globs:

```bash
code-review-graph review-context --base origin/main --scope 'src/**' --max-tokens 2000
code-review-graph detect-changes --for-review --scope 'tests/**' --max-tokens 1500
```

`--scope` filters emitted changed functions, review priorities, test gaps, and affected-flow summaries by repo-relative path. Nonmatching changed files stay out of the compact payload.

### 4. Watch mode (optional)
```bash
code-review-graph watch
```
Auto-updates the graph on every file save. Zero manual work.

### 5. Visualize the graph (optional)
```bash
code-review-graph visualize
open .code-review-graph/graph.html
```
Interactive D3.js force-directed graph. Starts collapsed (File nodes only) — click a file to expand its children. Use the search bar to filter, and click legend edge types to toggle visibility.

### 6. Semantic search (optional)
```bash
pip install "code-review-graph[embeddings]"
```
Then use `embed_graph_tool` to compute vectors. `semantic_search_nodes_tool` automatically uses vector similarity when matching embeddings are available and falls back to keyword/FTS search otherwise.

Embedding providers are local sentence-transformers, OpenAI-compatible endpoints, Google Gemini, and MiniMax. Local embeddings use `CRG_EMBEDDING_MODEL`; OpenAI-compatible providers use `CRG_OPENAI_BASE_URL`, `CRG_OPENAI_API_KEY`, and `CRG_OPENAI_MODEL`. Cloud providers are opt-in and print an egress warning unless `CRG_ACCEPT_CLOUD_EMBEDDINGS=1` is set.

### 7. Detect changes with risk scoring (v2)
```
Ask your MCP client: "Review my recent changes with risk scoring"
```
Uses `detect_changes_tool` to map diffs to affected functions, flows, communities, and test gaps.

### 8. Explore architecture (v2)
```
Ask your MCP client: "Show me the architecture of this project"
```
Uses `get_architecture_overview_tool` for community-based architecture map with coupling warnings.

### 9. Generate wiki (v2)
```bash
code-review-graph wiki
```
Creates markdown wiki pages for each detected community in `.code-review-graph/wiki/`.

### 10. Multi-repo search (v2)
```bash
code-review-graph register /path/to/other/repo --alias mylib
```
Then use `cross_repo_search_tool` to search across all registered repositories.

## Context Savings

CRG reduces review context by sending graph-derived structural context instead of broad file dumps. The exact reduction depends on the repository and change shape. The evaluation runner reports the current benchmark data used in the README:

```bash
code-review-graph eval --all
```

Since v2.3.4, review and impact tools include compact `context_savings` metadata. In v2.3.5 the CLI surfaced this as a boxed savings panel on both `detect-changes --brief` and `update --brief`, with a per-category breakdown (Functions / Tests / Risk / Other) that sums exactly to the graph response size. The panel is now titled `Change-analysis token savings` because it measures the change-analysis response against changed-file content, not a whole review session with agent transcripts or sub-agent fan-out. Add `--verify` to cross-check the displayed numbers against OpenAI's `cl100k_base` tokenizer (requires `pip install tiktoken`). All numbers are labelled estimated because they use a conservative approximation rather than model-specific tokenisation; calibration shows the estimate stays within ~1% of real GPT-4 tokens in aggregate. Small single-file changes can occasionally use more context than the raw file because graph metadata has overhead.

## Supported Languages

The parser currently covers Python, JavaScript, TypeScript/TSX, Go, Rust, Java, C/C++, C#, Ruby, Kotlin, Swift, PHP, Scala, Solidity, Dart, R, Perl, Lua/Luau, Objective-C, shell scripts, Elixir, Zig, PowerShell, Julia, ReScript, GDScript, Nix, Verilog/SystemVerilog, SQL, Vue/Svelte single-file components, Astro files parsed through the TypeScript parser, Jupyter/Databricks notebooks (`.ipynb`), and Perl XS files (`.xs`).

Extension-less scripts are detected by shebang for common bash/sh/zsh/ksh/dash/ash, Python, Node, Ruby, Perl, Lua, Rscript, and PHP interpreters.

Languages not covered yet can be added without a fork via a `.code-review-graph/languages.toml` config — see [CUSTOM_LANGUAGES.md](CUSTOM_LANGUAGES.md).

## What Gets Indexed

- **Nodes**: Files, Classes, Functions/Methods, Types, Tests
- **Edges**: CALLS, IMPORTS_FROM, INHERITS, IMPLEMENTS, CONTAINS, TESTED_BY, DEPENDS_ON

See [schema.md](schema.md) for full details.

## Ignore Patterns

By default, these paths are excluded from indexing:

```
.code-review-graph/**    node_modules/**    .git/**
__pycache__/**           *.pyc              .venv/**
venv/**                  dist/**            build/**
.next/**                 target/**          *.min.js
*.min.css                *.map              *.lock
package-lock.json        yarn.lock          *.db
*.sqlite                 *.db-journal
```

To add custom patterns, create a `.code-review-graphignore` file in your repo root (same syntax as `.gitignore`):

```
generated/**
vendor/**
*.generated.ts
```

In git repos, indexing is based on tracked files (`git ls-files`), so gitignored files are skipped automatically. Use `.code-review-graphignore` to exclude tracked files or when git isn't available.

Low-signal test-gap rows can be suppressed in `pyproject.toml` without overloading `.code-review-graphignore`:

```toml
[[tool.code-review-graph.test_gap_suppressions.rules]]
path_globs = ["generated/**"]
kinds = ["Function"]
name_patterns = ["build_generated_*"]
reason = "Generated boilerplate is covered through generator tests."
```

Suppressed rows are removed from compact `test_gaps`, and the payload reports `suppressed_test_gap_count` so broad rules remain visible during review.
