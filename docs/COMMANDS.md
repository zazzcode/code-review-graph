# detect-changes vs update --brief — which one?
# • detect-changes --brief: read-only. Asks "what's the impact of my current
#   changes against the existing graph?" Fast (~1s). Use this when the graph
#   is already up to date (the default, if you have hooks installed).
# • update --brief: re-parses your changed files into the graph FIRST, then
#   runs the same analysis at the end. Use this after a rebase, a big
#   change set, or whenever you suspect the graph is stale.
# Both end with an identical "Change-analysis token savings" panel.
# Use review-context when you want one command to refresh stale graph state
# and emit the same compact payload as detect-changes --for-review.

## Standalone Daemon CLI (`crg-daemon`)

The `crg-daemon` command is included with every `code-review-graph` installation — no
separate install required. It is also available as a standalone entry point. It mirrors the
`code-review-graph daemon` subcommands:

```bash
crg-daemon start [--foreground]       # Start the multi-repo watch daemon
crg-daemon stop                       # Stop the daemon and all watcher processes
crg-daemon restart [--foreground]     # Restart (stop + start)
crg-daemon status                     # Show daemon status, repos, and process liveness
crg-daemon logs [--repo ALIAS] [-f] [-n N]  # Tail daemon or per-repo log files
crg-daemon add <path> [--alias NAME]  # Add a repository to watch.toml
crg-daemon remove <path_or_alias>     # Remove a repository from watch.toml
```

### Configuration

The daemon reads its configuration from `~/.code-review-graph/watch.toml`:

```toml
session_name = "crg-watch"   # logical daemon name
log_dir = "~/.code-review-graph/logs"
poll_interval = 2            # seconds between config file polls

[[repos]]
path = "/home/user/project-a"
alias = "project-a"

[[repos]]
path = "/home/user/project-b"
alias = "project-b"
```

The daemon spawns one `code-review-graph watch` child process per repo,
managed via `subprocess.Popen`. It monitors the config file for changes and
automatically reconciles child processes (starting/stopping as repos are
added or removed). Health checks run every 30 seconds and automatically
restart dead watchers. No external dependencies (tmux, screen, etc.) are
required.
